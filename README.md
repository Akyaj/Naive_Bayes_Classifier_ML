# Naive_Bayes_Classifier_ML
- Naive Bayes Model for classification
- Naïve Bayes algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm, which is based on Bayes theorem and used for solving classification problems.
- It is mainly used in text classification that includes a high-dimensional training dataset.
- Naïve Bayes Classifier is one of the simple and most effective Classification algorithms which helps in building the fast machine learning models that can make quick predictions.
- It is a probabilistic classifier, which means it predicts on the basis of the probability of an object.
- Some popular examples of Naïve Bayes Algorithm are spam filtration, Sentimental analysis, and classifying articles.

# Dataset: Wine Dataset
This dataset is adapted from the Wine Data Set from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine by removing the information about the types of wine for unsupervised learning.

The following descriptions are adapted from the UCI webpage:

These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three types of wines.

The attributes are:

- Alcohol
- Malic acid
- Ash
- Alcalinity of ash
- Magnesium
- Total phenols
- Flavanoids
- Nonflavanoid phenols
- Proanthocyanins
- Color intensity
- Hue
- OD280/OD315 of diluted wines
- Proline
